✅ 2. Perform a Final Review of the Project (5 Marks)
Checklist for Final Review

✔ Code Structure & Readability: Ensure a clean separation of concerns (Controller, Service, Repository).
✔ Exception Handling: All possible errors (invalid IDs, insufficient balance) should be covered.
✔ API Responses: Responses should be clear and meaningful (HTTP Status Codes).
✔ Logging: Add logs in service methods to track operations.
✔ Security: Consider adding authentication/authorization in future versions.
✔ Database Management: H2 is great for testing, but a real-world app should use MySQL or PostgreSQL.

✅ 3. Prepare Project Documentation
Good documentation helps others understand and use your project effectively.
